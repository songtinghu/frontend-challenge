Short Summary

For this exercise, I had an opportunity to write the whole html and css on my own. 

The html part was a little challenging for me since I needed to figure out what the structure I wanted my final work looks like.

There were a lot of adjustments during the process, since I didn't have that much experience of getting idea of how many width, or pixels something should be.

I came to a problem that the nav bar is flush to the top of the page. To solve this problem, I searched online and got the solution that I needed to assign 0 pixels to the top for the status-bar. 

I also got frustrated by having the hover background wider than my desired screen width, and then I realized that the width that I assigned to the .content was too long.

I also met a problem of not being able to get all the schedule in a line and then I found out that I didn't put ";" to the 
line of the "text-align"

There are many tiny details that would really make a project fail and cost me a lot of time to find out.
It was a valuable experience to finally get the work look good. I reviewed some of the examples in my previous checkpoints to 
help me figure out how to write the complete html.
