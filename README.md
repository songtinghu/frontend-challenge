Short Summary

For this exercise, I had an opportunity to write the whole html and css on my own. 
The html part was a little challenging for me since I needed to figure out what the structure I wanted my final work looks like.
I also got frustrated by not being able to make the hover work, and then I realized that I forgot to add </div> at the end
of each bus lines.
I also met a problem of not being able to get all the schedule in a line and then I found out that I didn't put ";" to the 
line of the "text-align"
There are many tiny details that would really make a project fail and cost me a lot of time to find out.
It was a valuable experience to finally get the work look good. I reviewed some of the examples in my previous checkpoints to 
help me figure out how to write html.
